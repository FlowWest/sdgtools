# Notes 

Here are some notes for the data processing of model output files

## DSM2 DSS Data

For each scenario we have a few different dss files. For example scenario "FPV1Ma" the files
for this model are:

| Filename                  | Type   |
|---------------------------|--------|
| FPV1Ma.hof                 | text   |
| FPV1Ma_CCF.dss             | binary |
| FPV1Ma_SDG.dss             | binary |
| FPV1Ma_hydro.dss           | binary |
| hydro_echo_FPV1Ma.inp      | text   |
